# GameSpace

chaldeaprjkt's GameSpace is an alternative to the Google's proprietary implementation of the Game Dashboard with a goals of providing basic user-interface for the [Android Game Mode API](https://developer.android.com/games/gamemode/gamemode-api).

Gamespace requires several patches to be applied on the AOSP's SystemUI and Settings :
- [frameworks/base](https://github.com/chaldeaprjkt/chaldea_frameworks_base/commits/13/gamespace)
- [packages/apps/Settings](https://github.com/chaldeaprjkt/chaldea_packages_apps_Settings/commits/13/gamespace)
